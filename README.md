ExpressStore - Self Checkout App created as part of Group Project

Abstract : Shopping is one unavoidable task that we have to do, and a lot of time
gets wasted while shopping because of the long queues for checkout, sometimes 
leading to a frustrating experience for shoppers. 
ExpressStore allows users to save the time spent on waiting in long queues while
checking out at the retail store. It gives control to the user and makes grocery
shopping way more convenient; users can scan items from their mobile devices 
while they are picking them, pay online and walk right out of the door without 
ever having to deal with anyone.
